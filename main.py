>>> Generates a program that will take a phrase and count the total words in the phrase, total consonants (always including y), and the vowels (always excluding y). The program will then use the word count total as a size for the base of a pyramid that the program will build. Afterwards, the program will ask for a second sentence to determine if both sentences are anagrams.
